*I have been part of the learning lab since first semester my senior year. 
I have known about the learning lab since my sophomore year. 
The learning lab has taught me how to create a space to test out ideas with unconventional tools, work creatively, and find new ways to collaborate. 
At the learning lab I have learned technical skills such as editing, coding, and experience design. 
I love learning these skills because they allow me to learn how to communicate better and be a better citizen in my communities.
